# Personal Arch Setup Script

## Pre-reqs
These scripts and files are used to set up my personal Arch environment.
It requires a minimal Arch setup with Xorg installed.

## What does it set up?
These scripts set up the following:
- lightdm greeter
- i3 with rofi as a launcher
- rxvt-unicode with Oh-My-Zsh and the resize-font script
- Neovim editor with Packer and various plugins

A script is also available to install Firefox, Docker, and the man pages.
